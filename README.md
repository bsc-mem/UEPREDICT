# UEPREDICT
Method for model prediction and evaluation of DRAM Uncorrected Errors (UEs). It is structured as follows:

 - The folder [ue_precict](ue\_predict) is a module containing the necessary files and methods for training and evaluation.
 - The scripts [train_test.py](train\_test.py) and [evaluation.py](evaluation.py) provide a way of executing the aforementioned files by allowing to configure specific parameters, such as the length of the prediction window or the prediction frequency.
 - The folder [data](data) contains the files needed for training and evaluation.

In each directory there are further explanations and instructions.


## Running scripts

Scripts can be executed directly from the shell as python 3 files:

```shell
python3 train_test.py
```


## Arguments
